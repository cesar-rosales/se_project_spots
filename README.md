# Project: Spots  

## Overview  

Spots is a social media web application designed to ensure all elements display correctly across different screen sizes. This project requires more time and effort than previous ones, as there are still key features that need to be completed.

### Design Reference  

**Figma**

### Images  

Images should be exported directly from Figma. To optimize loading speeds, we recommend using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) for compression before adding them to the project.
